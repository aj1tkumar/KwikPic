Question 2 - Explain any 5 git commands. 


1. Git clone-Git clone basically makes an identical copy of the latest version of a project in a repository and saves it to your computer.

git clone <https://name-of-the-repository-link>

2. Git commit-Once we reach a certain point in development, we want to save our changes (maybe after a specific task or issue).
Git commit is like setting a checkpoint in the development process which you can go back to later if needed.
We also need to write a short message to explain what we have developed or changed in the source code.

git commit -m "commit message"

3. Git checkout-We use git checkout mostly for switching from one branch to another. We can also use it for checking out files and commits.

git checkout <name-of-your-branch>

4. Git status
The Git status command gives us all the necessary information about the current branch. 

git status

5. Git branch - We can use the git branch command for creating, listing and deleting branches.

git branch <branch-name>
